# Contributing to RiveAnimatedIcon
Thank you for taking out time to contribute!🎉

## Here are a few things to consider when making a contribution⬇️​

- If you are adding new icons animated in rive, ensure that icon assets are first imported into Rive and before you start animating, also ensure that you don't add any additional design to the icon in Rive.
  This is because at the moment Rive doesn't provide a dedicated API for changing asset color from code, with this we can ensure that the color of the icon is fully adjustable from your code.
  
- Make sure to remove unused artboards from your .riv file, so that the file size is minimal
  
- If you're animating a set of icons in rive, add all the icons to one artboard and to one file. This helps to get things well organized.
